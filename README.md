##### How to run the script:

In your terminal clone the project locally and run the below node command:

```
  git clone <project>
  node directories.js
```

- Notes:
  the files in `mock-inputs` are the input commands used by the script.
  - the program reads from a mock file located at:
    `./mock-inputs/commands.txt`
  - the ``./mock-inputs/dirTreeTest.json` file is the finalle directory representation after all the commands in the commands.txt file have been executed.
